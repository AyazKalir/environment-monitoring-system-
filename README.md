This project is created to learn how hardware and software work together.

# Environment Monitoring System

This project is a beginner-level embedded system created to understand how hardware and software work together in real life.

## Project Goal
The main goal of this project is to:
- Read environmental data from a sensor
- Send the data to a computer
- Process and observe the data using Python

## Technologies Used
- Arduino (or ESP32)
- Temperature / Humidity Sensor (DHT11 or similar)
- Python (Serial Communication)

## How It Works
1. The sensor reads environmental data.
2. Arduino sends the data through serial communication.
3. A Python script receives and displays the data.
4. Simple logic can be applied based on sensor values.

## Why I Built This
I built this project to improve my understanding of:
- Embedded systems
- Hardware-software interaction
- Real-world automation basics

## Future Improvements
- Data logging to files
- Graph visualization
- WiFi-based data transfer
- Automated decision-making

## Status
This project is actively being improved as I continue learning.
